Example python sphinx documentation
===================================

Introduction
------------

Everything I use when doing a python sphinx documentation. This is nice. It generates a pretty website using your code comments. So comment, comment, comment !!!! comment everything !!!!

You can view this generated documentation in this `external site github page <http://www.github.com/>`_

You are even able to link to a `local static page </static.html>`_. Go to this page to see the source code for every little thing you can do in restructed text.
